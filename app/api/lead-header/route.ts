Winterdelta is investing R&D resource into SaaS (projects such as Monaco and Athens) and primarily offers services through Hydra, a consulting op. Hydra seeks to revolutionise the technology horizon of humanity, enabling industry to accomplish new things in new ways. Hydraâ€™s current focus is on Voice, AI and Data Science. Not every product developed (and under-development) by Team Atreides is to be deployed by the space sector, but every product built is designed to imbue life into a journey towards the stars. Every product has distinguishing facets: It is hosted with Vercel, the PaaS. Built with NextJS14, data fetching is via useSWR. AI-native Interfaces. Caladan Design System. The Guinevere Color Palette.
